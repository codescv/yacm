# How to build

First, clone CyanogenMod following the instructions: [http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Build_for_m7].

It's mainly done just using `repo init` and `breakfast` commands.

Then place `zz-local.xml` in your ./repo/local_manifests directory, this file overrides the corresponding projects in cyanogenmod.
